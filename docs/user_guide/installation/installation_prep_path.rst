If you don't already have PDKs and tools set up, prepare your path to get set up with examples and PDKs to run:


.. parsed-literal::

   (venv) git clone -b v\ |release| https://github.com/siliconcompiler/siliconcompiler
   (venv) export SCPATH=<the full path for your siliconcompiler/siliconcompiler directory>
