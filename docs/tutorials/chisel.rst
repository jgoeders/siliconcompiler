Chisel frontend
================

SiliconCompiler has a :ref:`Chisel <chisel>` frontend that enables you to build Chisel designs for any supported SC target.  To get started using Chisel with SC, ensure that SC is installed following the directions from the :ref:`Installation` section, and install sbt from `here <https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html>`_.

To build a Chisel design, the only things you need to do differently from a configuration perspective are:

1) Add all required Scala files as sources. Keep in mind that other frontend-specific features such as include or library directories are not yet supported for the Chisel frontend.
2) Set the :keypath:`option, frontend` parameter to 'chisel'.

Otherwise, you can configure the build as normal.

For example, to build the GCD example from the `Chisel project template repo <https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-template>`_, first copy the following code into a file called "GCD.scala".

.. literalinclude:: examples/gcd_chisel/GCD.scala
  :language: scala

.. note::

    SC's Chisel driver script selects the module to build based on the 'design'
    parameter.  You must ensure that top-level module's class name matches the
    'design' parameter you have set, and that this module does not include a
    ``package`` statement.

This design can then be quickly compiled to a GDS using the command line:

.. literalinclude:: examples/gcd_chisel/run.sh
  :language: bash

Or using Python:

.. literalinclude:: examples/gcd_chisel/gcd_chisel.py

For more information on creating designs using Chisel, see the `Chisel docs <https://www.chisel-lang.org/chisel3/docs/introduction.html>`_.
