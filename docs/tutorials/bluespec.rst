Bluespec frontend
===================

SiliconCompiler has a Bluespec frontend that enables you to build :ref:`Bluespec <bluespec>` designs for any supported SC target.  To get started using Bluespec with SC, ensure that SC is installed following the directions from the :ref:`Installation` section, and download bsc or install it from source following the directions `here <https://github.com/B-Lang-org/bsc#download>`_. For Ubuntu 20.04, we've additionally provided a `setup script <https://github.com/siliconcompiler/siliconcompiler/blob/main/setup/install-bsc.sh>`_ to build it from source automatically.

To build a Bluespec design, the only things you need to do differently from a configuration perspective are:

1) Add the Bluespec top-level package as an 'input', and add all directories containing imported modules as entries in :keypath:`option,ydir`. Keep in mind that the Bluespec integration only supports specifying a single top-level source file, so you must use :keypath:`option,ydir` for all other sources.
2) Set the :keypath:`option, frontend` parameter to 'bluespec'.

Otherwise, you can configure the build as normal.

For example, to build this fibonacci example adapted from the `bsc smoke test <https://github.com/B-Lang-org/bsc/blob/main/examples/smoke_test/FibOne.bsv>`_, first copy the following code into a file called "FibOne.bsv".

.. literalinclude:: examples/fibone/FibOne.bsv
  :language: systemverilog

.. note::

    SC's Bluespec driver script selects the module to build based on the
    'design' parameter. You must ensure that the single file passed in via the
    'source' parameter contains a module name that matches the value in 'design'.

This design can then be quickly compiled to a GDS using the command line:

.. literalinclude:: examples/fibone/run.sh
  :language: bash

Or using Python:

.. literalinclude:: examples/fibone/fibone.py

For more information on creating designs using Bluespec, see the `Bluespec docs <https://github.com/B-Lang-org/bsc#documentation>`_.
